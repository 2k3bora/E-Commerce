After creating your private GitHub repository, run these commands:

# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ecommerce.git

# Or if you use SSH:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/ecommerce.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to:
# 1. Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
# 2. Or set up SSH keys for authentication
